# Username Registry

## 1. Project Title
**Username Registry on Stacks Blockchain**

## 2. Project Description
This is a minimal smart contract built using Clarity for registering unique usernames on the Stacks blockchain. Each user can claim a username that no one else can register, ensuring uniqueness and preventing duplication.

## 3. Project Vision
To create a decentralized username system where individuals can securely own and manage their identity without relying on centralized databases or services.

## 4. Future Scope
- Allow users to update their username.
- Enable username transfers between accounts.
- Implement an expiration and renewal mechanism.
- Add profile metadata such as bio, avatar URL, and social links.
- Integrate with decentralized applications for user login and display.

## 5. Contract â€” What is this?
In blockchain development, a **contract** (also called a *smart contract*) is a program deployed to the blockchain that automatically enforces rules and logic without requiring a trusted third party.  
In Clarity, a contract is written using the **Clarity language** and deployed on the Stacks blockchain. It is immutable once deployed and can handle things like storing data, transferring tokens, or in this case, registering usernames.
